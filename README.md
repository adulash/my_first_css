# Social Links Profile

Welcome to my first CSS styling project! üéâ

This project is a simple and elegant profile card featuring a bio section and social media links. It was created as a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ). The goal was to practice HTML and CSS while learning how to structure and style components.
